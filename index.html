      <p>
        Lacking food availability, limited food access, and irresponsible food utilization is a scary situation.  
      </p>
      <p>  
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Food access</span> refers to having <span style="font-weight:bold">available, nutritious</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold">affordable</span> food. When there is a lack of food access, the state of <span style="font-weight:bold">food insecurity</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">food desert rises</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>Nutrition and affordability are the two components of food accessibility.</p>
      <p>If food is affordable, it may not be nutritious enough to ensure a balanced diet.<sup>*</sup></p>
      <p>However, if available food is nutrient dense, the prices could be too high to purchase enough food.</p>
      <div id = "superscript">
       <p><span style = "font-size:2em">*</span>For example, fast-food and convenience stores may be available and affordable, but, they lack fresh produce, are highly processed, and often contain too much sodium or sugar.</p>

        <div id = "mapVis"></div>
        <p>Food insecurity affects those all around the world</p><br>
        <p>Within America, this is a prevalent issue among many communities and isn't going away anytime soon. Food insecurity is highest for <span style = "font-weight:bold">single-mother households</span> and <span style = "font-weight:bold">below-poverty-line</span> households. It also affects a wide range such as <span style = "font-weight:bold">urban cities</span>, <span style = "font-weight:bold">rural areas</span>, and <span style = "font-weight:bold">college students</span>.</p>

          <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact of food choices on life expectancy</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>Factors such as increased sugary drink consumption, increased saturated fat consumption, and increased trans fat consumption was correlated with increased risk for diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. With these substances being cheaper and more common, food deserts have a high concentration of sugary drinks and unhealthy fats so people in these areas are at a higher risk for these adverse health conditions. </p>
