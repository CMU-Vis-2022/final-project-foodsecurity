      </h2>
      <p id="whatText">
        Food insecurity is a state of limited
        <span style="font-weight: bold">food access</span>. Food insecurity is
        having
        <span style="font-weight: bold">no available, nutritious,</span> or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">affordable food.</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Food accessibility at its core is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nutrition</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">affordability</span> but it is also a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">paradox:</span><br />
        If food is affordable, it may not be nutritious enough to ensure a
        balanced diet. <br />
        If food is nutrient-dense, high prices lead to insufficient quantities
        of food.

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 2em">*</span>For example, fast-food and
          convenience stores may be available and affordable, but, they lack
          fresh produce, are highly processed, and often contain too much sodium

        So, what is food insecurity?

      </h4>
      <p>
        Furthermore, food insecurity is not a one-dimensional issue. It is not
        simply an issue of food access. In telling the convoluted narrative of
        food insecurity we must examine race, health, poverty, education, and
        more.

        <div id="mapVis" 
        alt="Using data from Feeding America and USDA, These choropleth 
        map visualizations showcase three maps of the United States by county. 
        Counties are smaller than states and typically comprise of several 
        cities. The first map, as seen in Figure 1, indicates the rate of 
        food insecurity within the county. The insecurity rate is determined 
        by the number of individuals experiencing food insecurity divided by 
        the total number of individuals within the county. The darker red 
        the county is, the higher the rate of food insecurity. The purpose 
        of this visualization is to indicate how widespread food insecurity
        is across America. Across all counties, food insecurity is prevalent 
        which further validates food insecurity as an issue."></div>
        <p>
          In the United States alone, there are
          <span style="font-weight: bold">34 million individuals</span>,
          including
          <span style="font-weight: bold">9 million children,</span> who are
          food insecure.
        </p>
        <p>
          From <span style="font-weight: bold">urban cities</span> to
          <span style="font-weight: bold">rural countryside</span>, counties all
          over America experience food insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the map, we can see that there is a level of insecurity in
          <span style="font-weight: bold">every</span> county. Also, many 
          counties have individuals living
          <span style="font-weight: bold">more than 10 miles</span> from a
          grocery store. For perspective,
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >if a grocery store were 10 miles away, this would require walking
            for 3 hours continuously.</span
          >
          We define this as low access to a grocery store and living in a <span style="font-weight: bold">food desert.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Within America, this is a prevalent issue among many communities and
          isn't going away anytime soon. Food insecurity is highest for
          <span style="font-weight: bold">single-mother households</span> and
          <span style="font-weight: bold">below-poverty-line</span> households.
          It also affects a wide range such as
          <span style="font-weight: bold">urban cities</span>,
          <span style="font-weight: bold">rural areas</span>, and
          <span style="font-weight: bold">college students</span>.

           For the third map, we provided the proportion of those 
           living more than 10 miles from a grocery store, which can be classified as 
           those living in a food desert. The takeaway from these supplemental maps 
           is to demonstrate the widespread trend that counties with lower population 
           densities have higher rates of food insecurity and are more likely to live in food deserts.
          ">
          <div id="miniMap1"></div>
          <div id="miniMap2"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          When comparing population density with the distribution of low access 
          to a grocery store, we can see that <span style="font-weight: bold">areas with lower population density
          have higher proportions of those with low access</span>, while areas with higher
          population density have lower proportions of those with low access.
        </p>
        <p>
          We considered transportation, such as having a car, as an exploratory
          predictor variable for food insecurity. From the data, we observed
          that <span style="font-weight: bold">for every county</span>, there is 
          <span style="font-weight: bold">less than 1% of indivudals who do not
          have a car</span>. Comparatively to countries like China, the United States
          is less densely populated. If we observe the population density map,
          we notice that majority of the US is not densely populated, with the
          exceptions of urban areas, which suggests that majority of those who
          live the US must have a car to get around. Public transportation is
          also not very developed outside urban areas, <span style="font-weight: bold">thus cars are a must to
            live in the US.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are an individual who lives greater than 10 miles away from a grocery 
          store, it equates up to 15 to 30 minute drive to the store. Individual takes around 
          45 mins to 1 hour to shop, resulting in a total of almost 
          <span style="font-weight: bold"> 2 hours to get groceries.</span> Increased travel
          time can reduce the inclination to make the trip. Depending on work hours, some individuals
          are more likely to shop at fast food or convenience stores given how their hours fit
          around regular grocery stores hours.

          Factors such as <span style="font-weight: bold">increased sugary drink consumption, increased
          saturated fat consumption, and increased trans fat consumption are
          correlated with increased risk for diabetes, obesity, and
          cardiovascular disease</span>. With these substances being cheaper and more
          common, food deserts have a high concentration of sugary drinks and
          unhealthy fats so people in these areas are at a higher risk for these
          adverse health conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triglycerides are a type of fat within our blood. Having high levels
          of triglycerides can increase the risk of heart disease. When we consume 
          food that have high calories, fats, and sugars, the extra calories and sugar 
          that are not used are stored as triglycerides in fat cells in our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 2017-2020 NHANES Survey, we can see that <span style="font-weight: bold">those who are
          considered to live in proverty</span> (individuals whos income to poverty
          guideline is ≤ 1) <span style="font-weight: bold">have the highest count of individuals with high
          triglycerides levels.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who live in poverty or are considered low income do not have the
          same access to nutritious and safe food as everyone else.
          Affordability is a huge factor to what kinds of food individuals have
          access to, with many of the low income individuals only being able to
          afford heavily processed food in high fats and sugar.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="whyVis" 
      alt="Using data from the CDC, we created a bar graph that measured individuals 
      with high tiglyceride levels by their income to poverty guideline ratio. Essentially the 
      further from poverty, the more likely the lower the high triglyceride levels.
       More importantly, the long-lasting effects of high levels could lead to obesity, diabetes, 
       and cardiovascular disease. While food insecurity may be perceived as a temporary issue, 
       its long-lasting effects can lead to poor long-term health and shorter life spans.">
