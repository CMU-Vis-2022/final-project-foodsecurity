      </h2>
      <p id="whatText">
        Food insecurity is a state of limited
        <span style="font-weight: bold">food access</span>. Food insecurity is
        having
        <span style="font-weight: bold">no available, nutritious,</span> or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">affordable food.</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Food accessibility at its core is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nutrition</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">affordability</span> but it is also a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">paradox:</span><br />
        If food is affordable, it may not be nutritious enough to ensure a
        balanced diet. <br />
        If food is nutrient-dense, high prices lead to insufficient quantities
        of food.

      <div id="superscript">
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 2em">*</span>For example, fast-food and
          convenience stores may be available and affordable, but, they lack
          fresh produce, are highly processed, and often contain too much sodium
          or sugar.

      <p>
        Furthermore, food insecurity is not a one-dimensional issue. It is not
        simply an issue of food access. In telling the convoluted narrative of
        food insecurity we must examine race, health, poverty, education, and
        more, <span style="font-weight: bold">Let's delve deeper...</span>

        <div id="mapVis"></div>
        <p>
          In the United States alone, there are
          <span style="font-weight: bold">34 million individuals</span>,
          including
          <span style="font-weight: bold">9 million children,</span> who are
          food insecure.
        </p>
        <p>
          From <span style="font-weight: bold">urban cities</span> to
          <span style="font-weight: bold">rural countryside</span>, counties all
          over America experience food insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the map, we can see that there is a level of insecurity in
          <span style="font-weight: bold">every</span> county. Also, many 
          counties have individuals living
          <span style="font-weight: bold">more than 10 miles</span> from a
          grocery store. For perspective,
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >if a grocery store were 10 miles away, this would require walking
            for 3 hours continuously.</span
          >
          We define this as low access to a grocery store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within America, this is a prevalent issue among many communities and
          isn't going away anytime soon. Food insecurity is highest for
          <span style="font-weight: bold">single-mother households</span> and
          <span style="font-weight: bold">below-poverty-line</span> households.
          It also affects a wide range such as
          <span style="font-weight: bold">urban cities</span>,
          <span style="font-weight: bold">rural areas</span>, and
          <span style="font-weight: bold">college students</span>.

        <p>
          When comparing population density with the distribution of low access 
          to a grocery store, we can see that areas with lower population density
          have greater low access to a grocery store and higher population density
          have lower low access to a grocery store. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We considered transportation, such as having a car, as an exploratory
          predictor variable for food insecurity. From the data, we observed
          that for every county, there is less than 1% of indivudals who do not
          have a car. Comparatively to countries like China, the United States
          is less densely populated. If we observe the population density map,
          we notice that majority of the US is not densely populated, with the
          exceptions of urban areas, which suggests that majority of those who
          live the US must have a car to get around. Public transportation is
          also not very developed outside urban areas, thus cars is a must to
          live in the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are an individual who lives greater than 10 miles away from a grocery 
          store, it equates up to 15 to 30 minute drive to the store. Individual takes around 
          45 mins to 1 hour to shop, resulting in a total of almost 
          <span style="font-weight: bold"> 2 hours to get groceries.</span> Increased travel
          time can reduce the inclination to make the trip. Depending on work hours, some individuals
          are more likely to shop at fast food or convenience stores given how their hours fit
          around regular grocery stores hours.

          Factors such as increased sugary drink consumption, increased
          saturated fat consumption, and increased trans fat consumption are
          correlated with increased risk for diabetes, obesity, and
          cardiovascular disease. With these substances being cheaper and more
          common, food deserts have a high concentration of sugary drinks and
          unhealthy fats so people in these areas are at a higher risk for these
          adverse health conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triglycerides are a type of fat within our blood. Having high levels
          of triglycerides can increase the risk of heart disease. Triglycerides
          are developed within our bodies and we can also get it from the foods
          we consume. When we consume food that have high calories, fats and
          sugars, the extra calories and sugar that are not used are stored as
          triglycerides in fat cells in our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 2017-2020 NHANES Survey, we can see that those who are
          considered to live in proverty (individuals whos income to poverty
          guideline is â‰¤ 1) have the highest count of individuals with high
          triglycerides levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who live in poverty or are considered low income do not have the
          same access to nutritious and safe food as everyone else.
          Affordability is a huge factor to what kinds of food individuals have
          access to, with many of the low income individuals only being able to
          afford heavily processed food in high fats and sugar.
